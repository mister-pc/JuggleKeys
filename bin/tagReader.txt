Installation:
-------------
Uncompress Tag to any directory. For easiest use I recommend including that
directory in PATH or uncompressing Tag to Windows directory.


Usage:
------
Tag is a command line tool, meaning that you have to type all the commands from
Command Prompt in Windows. If you are not familiar with Command Prompt you should
take a look at the great Frontend made by Speek.
You can download the Frontend from http://home.wanadoo.nl/~w.speek/tag.htm.

To use tag from command line type:

  Tag [options] <filenames / directories / @file_with_parameters>

[] means that options are optional, they are not needed
<> means that filenames / directories / @file_with_parameters are required

There are several options, to view basic options just execute Tag without any
parameters:

  Tag

To view every option use parameter --help:

  Tag --help

Different options are explained later in this readme.
Filenames and directories can contain wildcards '*' and '?'.
file_with_parameters is a text file that contains all the parameters you would
pass to Tag from command line.
For example *.* means every file in current directory, *.mp3 means every .mp3
file in current directory, a*.* means any file starting with 'a' in current
directory, a?.* means any file that has two characters in it's name and starts
with 'a'.
Tag also supports wildcards in directory names, for example:

  *\*.mp3

means any file with extension .mp3 in all subdirectories of current directory.
If Tag gets directory name as parameter it will search all files in in.
Other basic option regarding directories and file searching is --recursive, it
tells Tag to search files also from all subdirectories. For example command:

  Tag "C:\My Music\*.mp3" --recursive

will search all .mp3 files in "C:\My Music" and in all of it's subdirectories.
Filename can also be M3U playlist, Tag will then read filenames from it.
To learn more about features of Tag you can add option --test to command line
and no files will get modified.


Viewing tags:
-------------
Default mode of operation is to display contents of tags and with MP3s, MPCs and
Oggs also some information about the files.
To view this information simply call Tag with filenames as parameter. For example:

  Tag *.*

will display tags of all supported files in current directory.


Tagging:
--------
You have five ways to tag your files:
1. Let Tag guess the values for you from filename
2. Tell Tag how your files are named and it will generate values
3. Manually enter tag values
4. Combination of all of the above
5. Read tag information from tag.ini file or CDDB file

Method one is easiest but it requires that your files are named using one of the
standard naming schemes. Currently Tag recognizes about 50 different schemes, so
most probably it will work.
You can test if it will work for you by using following command in the directory with
files to be tagged:

  Tag --auto --test *.*

This will view tag values that would have been guessed by Tag. If you see text
"generated from name" on the screen and tag values are correct you know that guessing
works with your filenames.
To actually write the tags remove the parameter --test and use:

  Tag --auto *.*

If automatic mode didn't view correct information on your files you can manually
specify the scheme used in your filenames.
Scheme is the way filenames are constructed, telling which part of the name (or directory)
corresponds to what information. This is told by using identifiers and separators, possible
identifiers are:
 T = Title
 A = Artist
 L = Album
 N = Track number
 Y = Year
 G = Genre
 C = Comment
 X = text to be disrecarded
All other text is considered as separator. For example the scheme for file

  Red Hot Chili Peppers - 01 - Around The World.mp3

is

  A - N - T

You don't need to worry about the filename extension, it will be automatically
ignored.
Scheme can also be used with directories, for example if our example file was

  Californication\Red Hot Chili Peppers - 01 - Around The World.mp3

we can get the Album name with scheme

  L\A - N - T

If your filenames have more information just add new identifiers and Tag will use
the text in your tags. If there is some text in the middle of the name that you do
not want to store in tags you can use identifier X to mark it. For example

  C:\My Music\Rock\Full Albums\The Beatles\White Album\11. Blackbird.mp3

has text "Full Albums" after genre Rock, and we want to ignore that text. Scheme is

  G\X\A\L\N. T

Hopefully you now understand how schemes are constructed. You can now tag your files
with command:

  Tag --auto --scheme <scheme> <files>

If you first want to see what the resulting tags would be like, add parameter --test:

  Tag --test --auto --scheme <scheme> <files>

If you don't want to use automatic tag generation you can of course also enter all
information manually. There are easy-to-use switches to enter standard fields and
a general switch to enter any field to tags.
Easy switches are:
 --artist  <x>  : artist is <x>
 --title   <x>  : title is <x>
 --album   <x>  : album is <x>
 --track   <x>  : track number is <x>
 --comment <x>  : comment is <x>
 --genre   <x>  : genre is <x>
 --year    <x>  : year is <x>

General switch is:

 -t "item=x"    : item is x

Multiple calls to any of these switches are possible.

These switches can also be used when automatic tag generation is used, user entered
values will always override generated values.

To tag using tag.ini or CDDB file as source your files need to be in the same
directory with the source text files. And their names must be in form "TrackNN.XXX",
NN being the track number and XXX one of the supported file extensions.
After that simply call Tag with text file as parameter, for example:

  Tag *.

will search all files without extension and if they are CDDB files it will tag
tracks with the information from the file.

You can also use:

 - f "item=x"    : item will be set to the text contained within the external file x

This may be useful for storing cuesheet information in an APEv2 tag, for example:

  Tag -f "cuesheet=X:\CDImage.ape.cue" CDImage.ape

but can be used to store any text in any tag.

NB: The text contained in the file is stored, not the file itself.


Renaming:
---------
Tag allows fast mass renaming of files to match naming scheme you specify. You
can also move the files to subdirectories according to your scheme.
The renaming can be done by using tags already in your files, or if the files
don't have tags they can be renamed based on the scheme of original names.
To rename using tags you need to tell Tag the new scheme you want with parameter
--scheme. Let's assume our file

  Red Hot Chili Peppers - 01 - Around The World.mp3

has correct tags and we want to rename it to be

  01. Around The World.mp3

New name uses scheme "N. T" so we call Tag with command:

  Tag --rentag --scheme "N. T" <files>

To rename files without using tags option --scheme specifies scheme of old names.
If it is not specified Tag will try to autodetect it.
Parameter --rentag <newscheme> is used to specify the new scheme of files. The
command to rename our example file

  Red Hot Chili Peppers - 01 - Around The World.mp3

to

  01. Around The World.mp3

without using tags would be:

  Tag --scheme "A - N - T" --rentag "N. T" <files>

or since the above example would be autodetected you can simply call:

  Tag --rentag "N. T" <files>

If you also want to move the files to subdirectories use option --move. To move
our example file to subdirectory Californication we would add "L\" in front of
the new scheme and add option --move to command line. So with our example file
the command would be:

  Tag --rentag --scheme "L\N. T" --move <files>

or without using tags:

  Tag --rename "L\N. T" --move <files>


Generating Playlists:
---------------------
Tag can generate playlists for your tracks, naming the lists by the name of the
directory files are in, by scheme "Album artist - Album title", or use the name
you specify.
Playlists have playing times, Winamp's display title and AlbumList extensions by
default, but if wanted they can also contain only filenames.
By default playlists are sorted by track number, but they can also be sorted by
 duration:      track duration
 size:          filesize
 name:          name with full path
 path:          only file path
 basename:      filename without path
 extension:     file extension
 attrib:        file attributes
 time_access:   time file was last accessed
 time_create:   time file was created
 time, date:    time file was last modified
 bitrate:       bitrate of file
 channels:      audio channels in file
 samplerate:    samplerate of file
 format:        audio format
 <x>:           any item <x> in tag (artist, title, track, comment, genre, year...)

Sorting order can also be reversed.
You can tell Tag to write only one playlist of all files or to write multiple
playlists, one to every directory with files.
Tag will try to automatically detect album artist and album title from tags, but
those can also be given with parameters --a-artist and --a-title.
Sorting options are given with parameter --sort, and if you want to sort by multiple
properties add new properties with parameter --sort+.

Playlist options:
 --playlist        : generate one playlist per directory
 --oneplaylist     : generate one playlist from all files
 --playlists       : generate one playlist per album in current directory
 --a-artist <x>    : set album artist to <x>
 --a-title <x>     : set album title to <x>
 --onlyfiles       : writes only filenames in playlist, no extra information
 --dirname         : use directory name for playlist naming
 --plname <name>   : use <name> as playlist name.
 --slashes         : use slashes '/' instead of backslashes '\' in playlists
 --nospaces        : replaces space by underscore in names of written files
 --sort <by>       : sort playlist only by <x>
 --sort+ <x>       : add new playlist sorting property <x>
 --sortdesc        : sort in descending order

Example to write one big playlist of all .mp3 files and sort the playlist by
path and by track number:

  Tag --oneplaylist --sort path --sort+ track --recursive *.mp3


Outputting cuesheets:
---------------------
You can output the contents of an embedded cuesheet to file using one of the
--tocue switches.

To output the content to a file whose name is detirmed by tag values:

  Tag --tocue "%A - %L" <files>

To output the content to a specific file:

  Tag --tocuen "C:\My Music\CDImage.cue" "C:\My Music\CDImage.wv"

To output the content to a file with the same name as the source:

  Tag --tocuea <files>

If the file is "C:\CDImage.wv" the cuesheet will be called "C:\CDImage.wv.cue"

By default, using --tocue and --tocuea will overwrite existing files,
but --tocuen will append to an existing file.  To make --tocuen overwrite use
the --overwrite switch (hack).


Outputting tags to STDOUT:
--------------------------
To output the contents of a tag to STDOUT use:

  Tag --tostdoutn "EACLOG" "C:\My Music\CDImage.wv"

This can be used in conjunction with redirection to write tag contents to a text file:

  Tag --tostdoutn "EACLOG" "C:\My Music\CDImage.wv" > log.txt
  Tag --tostdoutn "COMMENT" "C:\My Music\CDImage.wv" > comment.txt

Only one tag can be written at a time.


Removing tags:
--------------
You can remove all supported tags from files and with ID3v2 version also just
ID3v2 tags.
To remove all tags use command:

  Tag --remove <files>

and to remove only ID3v2 tags:

  Tag --removeid3v2 <files>


All options:
------------
 --title   <value> : set title to <value>
 --artist  <value> : set artist to <value>
 --album   <value> : set album to <value>
 --year    <value> : set year to <value>
 --comment <value> : set comment to <value>
 --track   <value> : set track number to <value>
 --genre   <value> : set genre to <value>

Tag fields can also be set with:
 -t <item=x>       : set tag item <item> to value <x>
 -f <item=x>       : set tag item <item> from content of file <x>
 -u <item=x>       : set tag item <item> to value <x> (x is UTF-8 coded)

(*) Some small additions

Version 2.0 RC7:
(-) NFO file generator was too anxious in replacing characters
(+) Character replacement can now be customized in config file
(+) New option --tofileext <ext> allows selecting extension for generated name

Version 2.0 RC6:
(+) New option --plname <name> allows user specify name for playlist
(+) New option --slashes converts backslashes to slashes in playlists
(-) Screen output writing didn't append to existing file when name was made using scheme
(-) Renaming had character ignoring bugs

Version 2.0 RC5:
(+) Pictures from ID3v2 tags are saved in APE tags
(+) .nfo file generator is finished, template is read from config file
(+) New options, --a-artist defines album artist and --a-title defines album title.
    Both are used with playlists and .nfo file.
(+) Decoding is back. Supports mpc, mp3 and ape. Other decoders don't allow naming output

Version 2.0 RC4:
(+) Tag info reading from tag.ini and CDDB files is back. There is no option
    --inimode anymore, feature is used by entering name of the file as parameter.
(+) Output direction to text files, option --tofile <scheme> writes screen output
    to file generated from scheme (tag data from first file).
    --tofilen <file> writes output to <file>.
(+) New option --nospaces, all files generated by Tag will have spaces replaced by
    underscore.

Version 2.0 RC3:
(-) Lots of bugs fixed, too many to remember all

Version 2.0 RC2:
(-) Tags were not written when manually setting fields
(-) Ogg tags couldn't be saved
(+) New option -u to insert tag fields coded in UTF-8
(*) Some improvements to internal tag handling

Version 2.0 RC1:
(*) Total code rewrite.
    Some functions that were previously supported are not implemented yet
    but all functions shown on usage screen are implemented and should work.
(-) No longer crashes when reading files with multiple tags (this happened with v1.33)
(+) Full wildcard support for directories.
    (Command "tag */s*/*.*" would search all files in directories starting with 's'
    in all directories under current working directory.)
(+) Now accepts directories as parameters.
(*) New option --oneplaylist to write one playlist of all files. Options --playlist creates
    one playlist in every directory there are files.
(*) Sort improved. Option --sortdesc reverses sort order. Multiple --sort+ parameters define
    multiple rules to sort by. Accepted parameters are:
    duration: total song playtime
    size:     filesize
    name:     name with full path
    path:     only file path
    basename: filename without path
    extension: file extension
    attrib:   file attributes
    time_access: time file was last accessed
    time_create: time file was created
    time_write, time, date: time file was last modified
    bitrate:  bitrate of file
    channels: audio channels in file
    samplerate: samplerate of file
    format:   audio format
    <x>:      any item in tag (artist, title, track, comment, genre, year...)
(*) Can now write multiple tags at once (use --force multiple times)
(*) With --oldtype writes all tags that were in file
(+) Displays basic information about MP3s, MPCs and Oggs (can be disabled with --hideinfo)

Version 1.324:
(*) Fixes and improvements to --inimode
(*) Improved long title cutting with ID3v1 tags (>30 characters).
    If moving parenthesis to comment field doesn't cut title, this is done.
